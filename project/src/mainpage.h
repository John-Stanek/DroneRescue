 * This is a colllaborative project between four students to create a drone search and rescue system.
 * The drone patrols the map constantly taking pictures. The drone utilizes an image processing system (iimageio library) to scan the pictures it takes for the robot. Once detected, the drone will beeline to the Robot's position.
 * Other entities can be created as well such as hospitals and recharge stations.
 * Simply use the arrow keys to move the drone. Click 'p' to patrol the map. Click 'b' to beeline to a position.
 * 
 * \n\n 
 * This project can be made by running "make" in the terminal with the given make file. This will successfully compile the code, which can then be run with the following: \n
 * "./build/web-app 8081 web/"\n
