 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This semester, weâ€™ll be working on a fun visual project using interactive 3D computer graphics.  
 * You are tasked with building a virtual drone search and rescue system from the ground up.  
 * The utility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, continues to grow.  
 * Not only can they be used to make movies and deliver packages, perhaps they can be used to save lives.  
 * As with anything, however, new technologies require overcoming significant challenges before implementation and deployment.  
 * These include but are not limited to physics, logistics, route planning, malfunctions, power, and cost.  
 * You and your team will prototype and simulate a real-world application, and optimize it for productivity in three separate iterations:
